Hop, leap, and bound through vibrant levels as Squatbot! Using a unique and minimal control scheme, Squatbot brings tight platforming to mobile devices.

In Squatbot, there are no onscreen controls, simply tap left to jump left or tap right to jump right. Build and maintain your momentum as you race through challenging levels.

Squatbot deconstructs the platforming experience on mobile and distills it down the perfect jump.
