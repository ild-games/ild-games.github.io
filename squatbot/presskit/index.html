                </div>
                Squatbot brings tight, momentum-based platforming to mobile phones, with a control scheme designed specifically for touch
                screens. By tying the player's acceleration to their jump, Squatbot only requires two inputs - A tap on the
                left side of the screen to hop left, or a tap on the right side of the screen to hop right.
                <br />
                <br /> These minimalist controls open the door to challenging, kinetic level design, with Squatbot hopping, skipping,
                and jumping through exciting challenges.

                <div class="sectionHeader">History</div>
                What was originally conceived of as a weekend-long game jam became a long term passion project, and ultimately led to the
                founding of ILD Games as a full time studio.
                <br/>
                <br/> Squatbot first started life as Squatman, a Mario Maker level that Nick Defossez (Now ILD's head designer)
                had made for fun. This proto-Squatbot had the player duck down as big Mario, so that they would move through
                the level by building up momentum while jumping, rather than by running left and right. This level enjoyed
                very modest success, with hundreds of players attempting it thousands of times.
                <br/>
                <br/> Meanwhile, Jeff Swenson and Tucker Lein (ILD's founding members) had just finished development of a 2D game
                engine and editor as a hobby project, and wanted to create a small scale mobile game to stress test it. As
                they were brainstorming concepts, Nick approached the team with the concept of simplifying bringing Squatman's
                momentum-based platforming to touch screens, by simplifying controls to just two inputs - Jump left, and
                jump right.
                <br/>
                <br/> After bringing on animator James McNulty, and an initial weekend jam developing a prototype, all four members
                of the team decided to keep pursuing the project. After about a year in development, Squatbot is nearing
                completion, and Tucker and Nick have been able to leave their old jobs to work at ILD Games full time, developing
                a new project.
